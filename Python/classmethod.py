# A class method takes cls as first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.

# A class method can access or modify class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.

# In general, static methods know nothing about class state. They are utility type methods
#  that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods
#  must have class as parameter
