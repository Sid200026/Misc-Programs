import { Route, Link, BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'

React Router gives us three components Route Link and BrowserRouter

Route Component

In this component we have two parameters

1. path: we need to specify the path
2. component: which component the user needs to see

    render() {
        return(
            <div>
                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <Router>
                    <Route path="/name" component = {Name} />
                    <Route path="/age" component = {Age} />
                </Router>
            </div>
        )
    }

<Route path="/name" component = {Name} />
<Route path="/name/age" component = {Age} />

However on running this we can find that Name and Age components are rendered 
To avoid this we use the attribute exact so that only that exact URL renders that component

Added Navigation Using Link Component

<Link to="/">Users</Link>

<Route path="users/:id" component={Users} />

This will pass the id as props to component Users
/users/5 => This will pass 5 as props
