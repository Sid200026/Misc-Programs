This note is in Java

For implementing Regular Expressions in Java, we need two classes
Pattern and Matcher

import java.util.regex.*;

Pattern p = Pattern.create("the");

This will find all the patterns that have the word the
However this is case sensitive

To make it case sensitive we have two ways

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("the", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);

OR

Pattern p =Pattern.compile("(?i)(the)")

WE HAVE CREATED A PATTERN. NOW WE HAVE TO MATCH IT WITH A GIVEN STRING

For this we will be use the matcher class

Matcher m = pattern.matcher("The sky is blue today. The water is also blue. The world is blue");

find() is used to search for multiple occurence of pattern in the string
start() is used to get the first index when the pattern was matched
end()-1 wll give the last index
groupCount() is used to find total number if matched patterns in the string

while(m.find())
{
    Sopln(m.start(), m.last()-1);  // First and last index
}

Split based on some pattern

String delimiter = "\\d"     \d is regex for digits
String str = "A1BC2DEFR4";
Pattern p = Pattern.compile(delimiter, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
String result[] = pattern.split(str);
for(String s : result){
    Sopln(s);
}

OUTPUT

A
BC
DEFR
